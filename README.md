# THIS REPO HAS BEEN ARCHIVED
I am archiving this repo in favor of my new debloat script, [windebloater](https://github.com/technocapeman/windebloater). It is a fork of [win10script](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/win10script) by [@ChrisTitusTech](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech), and it includes a GUI and much more options for setting up a new Windows 10 install.

# OptimizeWindows10
**WARNING: I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOUR SYSTEM. THIS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

Out of the box, Windows 10 is an EXTREMELY bloated operating system. Processes such as Cortana and telemetry are known 
to slow down your system, and Windows 10 also comes with useless apps as well, many of which are sponsored. These 
scripts, tweaked by Kapilesh Pennichetty, will debloat your Windows 10 system so that you can enjoy a fast, seamless 
computing experience with Windows 10.

To run:
- Open Powershell as Admin
- Navigate to the directory where you have the desired debloat script stored
- Set the execution policy to unrestricted
- Then, run the script and restart your computer when prompted to do so

Any errors that are shown can be ignored. Enjoy your speedy Windows 10 experience!
